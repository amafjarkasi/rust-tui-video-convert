# üé¨ Rust TUI Video Converter

A powerful terminal-based video converter application built with Rust and Ratatui. This elegant TUI (Terminal User Interface) tool transforms the typically complex process of video conversion into a streamlined, visually appealing experience right in your terminal.

**Rust TUI Video Converter** combines the performance benefits of Rust with the flexibility of multiple conversion backends. Whether you're a content creator needing to convert videos for different platforms, a developer working with multimedia files, or just someone looking to change video formats without the bloat of GUI applications, this tool provides a lightweight yet powerful solution.

The application intelligently adapts to your system's capabilities - using native Rust implementations when available, falling back to external FFmpeg when installed, or running in simulation mode for demonstration purposes. All of this is presented through a beautiful, responsive terminal interface with real-time progress tracking and intuitive keyboard navigation.
